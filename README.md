## Abstract
Query optimization is a fundamental task in database systems that is crucial to providing high performance. 
To evaluate learned and traditional optimizer's performance, several benchmarks, such as the widely used JOB benchmark, are used. 
However, in this paper, we argue that existing benchmarks are inherently limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned optimizers. 
In fact, simple but realistic properties, such as joins over string columns or complex filter predicates, can drastically reduce the performance of existing query optimizers. 
Thus, we introduce **JOB-Complex**, a new benchmark designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting real-world complexity. 
Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution plans, making it a valuable resource to evaluate the performance of query optimizers and cost models in real-world scenarios. 
In our evaluation, we show that traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal plans.

# JOB-Complex
The 30 JOB-Complex SQL queries are listed in `JOB-Complex.sql`. These queries build on the JOB benchmark and are designed to incorporate real-world complexities often missing in standard benchmarks.

## The Need For A New Benchmark
Standard benchmarks like TPC-H, JOB, and JOB-light do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of real-world workloads.
- TPC-H uses synthetic data lacking real-world correlations.
- JOB & JOB-light, while using real-world data (IMDB), still operate under simplifying assumptions (e.g., normalized schemas, PK/FK constraints rigidly enforced).
- Real-world scenarios often involve joins on non-key columns, string-based join conditions, and complex filter predicates (e.g., `LIKE`, `IN` clauses with many values).
Current standard benchmarks fail to adequately capture these properties, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating query optimizers and often resulting in overly optimistic performance assessments.

## Introducing JOB-Complex
To address this gap, JOB-Complex offers a novel and hard benchmark.
- It consists of 30 hand-crafted SQL queries.
- These queries reflect real-world conditions:
    - Joins on non-primary/foreign key columns
    - Joins on string columns
    - Complex filter predicates
- It provides multiple execution plans for each query (~6000 in total), including physical plans with estimated/actual costs and cardinalities. This is crucial for learned approaches.
- JOB-Complex demonstrates how relatively simple modifications to the well-known JOB-benchmark can create a significantly more challenging and realistic benchmark.
- It shows an optimization gap of up to **11.13x** with PostgreSQL and **9.68x** with the learned Zero-Shot model, significantly higher than JOB (1.99x) and JOB-light (1.18x).

### Key Characteristics Comparison

*Runtimes are aggregated over all queries in each benchmark.*

An example query snippet from JOB-Complex highlighting these complexities:
```sql
SELECT MIN(chn.name), ...
FROM complete_cast cc, comp_cast_type cct1, comp_cast_type cct2, ... -- (11 other tables)
WHERE cct1.kind = 'cast'
AND cct2.kind LIKE '%complete%'
AND chn.name IS NOT NULL
AND (chn.name LIKE '%man%'
    OR chn.name LIKE '%Man%')   -- Complex Predicates
AND k.keyword IN (...)
AND ... -- (other filters)
AND chn.id = ci.person_role_id          -- w/o PK
AND ak.name_pcode_cf=n.name_pcode_cf    -- on strings
AND ak.name_pcode_nf=chn.name_pcode_nf  -- on strings
AND ... -- (other join conditions)
```

## Contributions
1. We introduce **JOB-Complex**, a novel benchmark for query optimization and cost estimation that incorporates real-world challenges such as joins on non-primary/foreign key columns, joins on string columns, and complex filter predicates.
2. We make **JOB-Complex** publicly available ([github](https://github.com/DataManagementLab/JOB-Complex/) to foster future research and development in query optimization, encouraging the community to address these identified challenges.

# Download Plan-Selection Dataset
You can download the plan selection datasets for JOB-Complex, JOB and JOB-light from [here](https://osf.io/53de6/?view_only=f304ebe762f34f65a3ce591340b89818).
They include tens of thousands of plans for the different benchmarks.
All plans are in the format of the PostgreSQL 'EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, VERBOSE, FORMAT JSON)' command.
Further these datasets include in addition also query plans which timed out.
You can identify these by the 'timeout' flag that is set, and the missing runtime measurement.

# Analysis Notebook
All our notebooks to analyze the speedup potential, query optimization performance, cost & cardinality estimation accuracy you can find in the notebooks folders.
Here the results of the learned cost models on these benchmarks are also stored.
